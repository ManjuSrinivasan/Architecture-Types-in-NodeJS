# Serverless Architecture :
     
      * Serverless architecture is a cloud computing approach to building and running apps and services without the need for infrastructure management. 
      * In serverless apps, code execution is managed by a server, allowing developers to deploy code without worrying about server maintenance and provision. 
      * In fact, serverless doesn’t mean “no server.”The application is still running on servers, but a third-party cloud service like AWS takes full responsibility for these servers.
      *  A serverless architecture eliminates the need for extra resources, application scaling, server maintenance, and database and storage systems.
      * In short, going “serverless” means that you don’t need to take care of the servers running your app.

#  The serverless architecture incorporates two concepts:

        * FaaS ( Function as a Service) – a cloud computing model which allows developers to upload pieces of functionality to the cloud and let these pieces be executed independently

        * BaaS ( Backend as a Service) – a cloud computing model which allows developers to outsource backend aspects (database management, cloud storage, hosting, user authentication, etc.) and write and maintain only the frontend part
