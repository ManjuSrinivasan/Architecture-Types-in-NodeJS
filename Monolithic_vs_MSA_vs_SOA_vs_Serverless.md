# Microservices vs. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) vs. Monolithic Architecture: The Differences
  
     * Now we can compare these three software architectures to define the differences between them visually.

     * Monolithic apps consist of interdependent, indivisible units and feature very low development speed. 

     * SOA is broken into smaller, moderately coupled services, and features slow development.

     * Microservices are very small, loosely coupled independent services and feature rapid continuous development.
     
     * Serverless software architecture is beneficial for accomplishing one-time tasks and auxiliary processes. It works great for client-heavy apps and apps that are growing fast and need to scale limitlessly.
