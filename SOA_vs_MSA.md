# MSA vs SOA :

    * Microservices Architecture (MSA) and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) both rely on services as the main component.
    * But they vary greatly in terms of service characteristics.


# SOA defines four basic service types as depicted below:

# MSAs have limited service taxonomy. The architecture consists of two service types as depicted below.

# Microservices vs. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) vs. Monolithic Architecture: 
  
     * Now we can compare these three software architectures to define the differences between them visually.

     * Monolithic apps consist of interdependent, indivisible units and feature very low development speed. 
     * SOA is broken into smaller, moderately coupled services, and features slow development.
     * Microservices are very small, loosely coupled independent services and feature rapid continuous development.
